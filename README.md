# Diabetes Risk Prediction with GAMs

This capstone project explores the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to predict the risk of diabetes using health survey data.

## 🔍 Project Summary
- Built an end-to-end pipeline in R to clean, analyze, and model diabetes-related health data.
- Developed a GAM using the `mgcv` package to capture non-linear effects of predictors.
- Compared model performance to logistic regression.
- Visualized model terms using `ggplot2` for interpretability.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and modeling notebook.
- `scripts/`: Modular R scripts for data cleaning and model building.
- `outputs/figures/`: Visualizations of partial dependence and smooth terms.
- `data/`: Sample data (or instructions to access it).

## 📊 Tools Used
- R, mgcv, ggplot2, dplyr
